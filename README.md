# Object-Oriented Programming in C++ â€“ Lab Sheets

This repository contains C++ lab sheets and solutions for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in the second semester of **BSc. CSIT** under **Tribhuvan University**.  
Topics include classes, inheritance, polymorphism, file handling, and more. These lab sheets are useful for students of **BSc. CSIT**, **BIT**, **BCA**, and **BIM**.
